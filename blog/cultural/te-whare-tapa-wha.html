    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Wha - My plan for the 4 dimensions of wellbeing</h1>
    <p>
      <li>Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa Whā model is a holistic model of wellbeing that encompasses four dimensions of health: physical, mental, social, and spiritual. Here is my wellbeing plan using this model:</li>
      <li>Taha Tinana: Physical Wellbeing</li>
      1. Exercising at least an hour a day for 5 days a week. In either the form of squash or gym
      <div></div>
      2. Eat a balanced and nutritious diet, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
      <div></div>
      3. Formulate a healthy sleep routine, aiming for 7-9 hours per night and ensure I am sleeping and waking at effectively the same time every day.
      <div></div>
      4. Ensure I take the time to visit healthcare professionals to monitor my physical health.
      <div></div>
      5. Make sure to spend plenty of time in the sun when I can as Vitamin D is massively important to immune health & cognitive function.

      <li>Why is EQ important?</li>
      One of the reasons why EQ is important is because it helps us navigate our relationships with others. By being able to understand and empathize with others' emotions, we are better equipped to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, and build stronger connections with those around us. In the workplace, having a high EQ can also lead to better leadership, collaboration, and teamwork, as well as improved customer service and sales performance.
      In addition, research has shown that people with higher EQ tend to be more resilient in the face of challenges and stress. By being able to regulate their own emotions and respond appropriately to the emotions of others, they are better able to cope with difficult situations and bounce back from setbacks.
      Overall, while IQ may be important for academic and technical success, EQ is crucial for personal and professional success. By developing our emotional intelligence, we can improve our relationships, communication, and overall well-being.
