    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <p>
      <li>What is emotional intelligence?</li>  
      Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to recognize and understand our own emotions and the emotions of others, and to use this understanding to guide our behavior and interactions. It encompasses skills such as empathy, self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, and social skills.
      <li>How is EQ different to IQ?</li>
      While IQ, or intelligence quotient, measures our cognitive abilities such as problem-solving and logical reasoning, EQ focuses on our emotional and social skills. While having a high IQ can be an advantage in certain fields, EQ is equally important, if not more so, in many aspects of life such as relationships, leadership, and teamwork.
      <li>Why is EQ important?</li>
      One of the reasons why EQ is important is because it helps us navigate our relationships with others. By being able to understand and empathize with others' emotions, we are better equipped to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, and build stronger connections with those around us. In the workplace, having a high EQ can also lead to better leadership, collaboration, and teamwork, as well as improved customer service and sales performance.
      In addition, research has shown that people with higher EQ tend to be more resilient in the face of challenges and stress. By being able to regulate their own emotions and respond appropriately to the emotions of others, they are better able to cope with difficult situations and bounce back from setbacks.
      Overall, while IQ may be important for academic and technical success, EQ is crucial for personal and professional success. By developing our emotional intelligence, we can improve our relationships, communication, and overall well-being.
