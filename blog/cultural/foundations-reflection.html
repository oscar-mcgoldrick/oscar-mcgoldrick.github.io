    <h1>Core Learnings in Foundations</h1>
    <p>
      <li>What are three new things you've learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</li>
    <div>One thing I have learned is that when I get really stuck I tend to become quickly overly critical of myself. I'm not sure that I have found a way around this directly yet - however some ways that I have been mitigating this is to seek help from others, and to take a good amount of time away from the problem to clear my mind.</div>
    <div>Another new thing I have learned about myself is to become properly self aware and reflective during my study. Practicing mindfulness and introspection, I have been able to recognise patterns in my thinking and behaviour which has enabled me to make adjustments to better align my work with my values and goals.</div>
    <div>Finally I have learned how to manage my expectations and create a healthy balance between my expected work outcome and the result. I am now expecting failure and ambracing it just as much as my successes - because this means I am operating in a learning space and still being challenged. I am trying my best to know that I will not create perfection, and that is totally fine! </div>
      <li>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning programming?</li>
    <div>Values are important in programming because they guide our decision-making and behavior. When we are clear on our values, we are better able to prioritize what is important to us and make choices that align with our beliefs. This is especially important in programming, where we often have to make trade-offs between different solutions or approaches.</div>
    <div>Empathy is crucial in programming because we are often designing and building products for other people. By putting ourselves in our users' shoes, we can better understand their needs and create solutions that are intuitive and user-friendly. Empathy is also important when working in teams, as it allows us to better understand and communicate with our colleagues.</div>
    <div>Self-awareness is important in programming because it helps us to identify our own biases, strengths, and weaknesses. By understanding ourselves better, we can make better decisions and work more effectively with others. Self-awareness also helps us to stay focused on our goals and make progress towards them.</div>
      <li>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</li>
    One thing that has surprised me about the core learning is how much of it has been focused on personal development and growth, rather than technical skills. While I expected to learn some programming fundamentals, I did not anticipate spending so much time on topics such as values, empathy, and self-awareness. However, I have come to appreciate how these skills are just as important, if not more so, than technical skills when it comes to being a successful programmer.
    <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
    One of the most challenging aspects of the core learning for me has been confronting my own limitations and mistakes. As someone who tends to be perfectionistic and critical of myself, it has been difficult to accept that I will make mistakes and that it's okay to not know everything. Additionally, some of the exercises, such as the empathy mapping, have pushed me out of my comfort zone and required me to be vulnerable with others.
      <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</li>
    I believe that focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course is important because it helps to develop well-rounded, empathetic programmers who can work effectively in teams and create products that meet users' needs. While technical skills are important, they are not sufficient on their own to be a successful programmer. By emphasizing values, empathy, and self-awareness, we are creating a culture that values collaboration, communication, and personal growth.
      <li>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</li>
    No definitely not. Studying core learning, such as values, empathy, and self-awareness, is crucial in a web development boot camp course because it is not just about coding. Developing a website or application requires a variety of skills beyond coding, including teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Core learning helps students develop these essential skills, which are important for success in any career.
    Spending time on core learning may seem like it takes away from valuable programming practice time, but in reality, it is a necessary investment. Having a strong foundation in core learning can help students become better programmers and problem-solvers. It can also help them develop a better understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses, which can improve their overall performance in the program.
