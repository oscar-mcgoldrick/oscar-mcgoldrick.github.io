      <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
      <p>
        <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>  
      I want to learn the necessary skills to take me into a fast paced agile work environment to be a part of a collaborative and engaging team. I hope to work in a space that requires high level problem solving too - so my hope over the coming weeks is to develop my skillset enough to take me into this dream scenario!
        <li>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>
      My biggest strengths have definitely been my problem solving techniques. I have managed to solve problems that are a lot more complex than I would have thought I could achieve already and this will be a big strength coming into bootcamp. However, I have noticed that my tendency to become overly self critical can be a real hindrence to motivation and progression. My ability to manage my own time has also proved poor, this may or may not impact my bootcamp experience quite heavily depending on how much content I have to look at in my own time.
        <li>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be</li>
      One thing I think I will struggle with at bootcamp in a non-technical light is focussing for the full 9 weeks. One thing I will try to mitigate any loss of focus is to find new reasons for motivation each week. I will make it my goal to find one thing from the weeks learning that will help me towards my overall long term goal. If I can do that, then I am confident that will give me motivation enough to focus up for the week.
        <li>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
      I haven't spent a lot of time working in groups, and while I am quite comfortable working with and talking to other people - I think all skills of working in a team are skills that I will need to improve. Communication, giving and receiving feedback and collaboratively attacking problems are all areas which I know I will have to develop, and for this I'm eager and excited.
        <li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
      I don't have an enormous amount of change on what I expect from the bootcamp team from the foundations period. As long as they abide by the DevAcademy core values I think all expectations will be met!
        <li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li>
      I expect to develop better introspective and time management tools during bootcamp. The following 9 weeks are not something that I expect to be easy by any stretch, so in order to adequitely adapt to the challenge I expect that I will need to make some changes in how I address my daily routine. Whether that is coming up with a checklist, or a form of accountability system with my at home support network. Something will need to be put into effect in order to ensure that I meet the required input each week. I also expect to become quite self-critical at times, so I need to find ways to manage this so that I maintain a healthy mindset.

    <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    <p>
      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>  
    I pride myself on my interpersonal skills, and would like to continue working in an environment that will further develop them. That said, I'm also excited to begin working in a more technical space where I will have my skillset broadened and challenged. Finding work that is challenging, stimulating and opens up opportunity for me is a big long term goal. 
      <li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>
    I am a confident in my abililty as a learner, and as a question-asker. Often I distract myself from learning however, and this can lead to serious disruptions to positive workflow over extended periods.
      <li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
    I don't fully understand the question but one skill I would like to develop is my ability to work productively & efficiently in my own time. I have never been one for time-management & self-management, but this is something I can tell I will not be able to get through this course without.
      <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        <ol>1. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representitives</ol>  
        <ol>2. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</ol>
      </li>
    I will manage my workload during this programme by ensuring I accurately respond to deadlines, and timeboxes for tasks. Completing my technical and cultural development tasks in an efficient manner is important to me, as this will give me time through each week to reflect on my work & ask for relevent help if necessary. If I find myself to be struggling with content or time-management I will be conscious to reach out and find appropriate help.
      <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
    The provided platforms of Discord & Slack have already proved extremely effective in finding out further information, or reaching out about something I get stuck on. My homegroup text chat is my first port of call, failing that I will notify facilitators via DM, or broadly in the foundations groupchat.      
      <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
    The facilitation team has already proved supportive and tentitive to my needs. Respect & communication is expected, but of course this can only be mutual! :)
      <li>Any scheduling information such as block out times when you are committed to other things.</li>
    Time is one thing that I have given myself plenty of between now and the end of the course. All day every day - I am available to be working on content.
