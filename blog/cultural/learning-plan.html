    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <p>
      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>  
    I pride myself on my interpersonal skills, and would like to continue working in an environment that will further develop them. That said, I'm also excited to begin working in a more technical space where I will have my skillset broadened and challenged. Finding work that is challenging, stimulating and opens up opportunity for me is a big long term goal. 
      <li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>
    I am a confident in my abililty as a learner, and as a question-asker. Often I distract myself from learning however, and this can lead to serious disruptions to positive workflow over extended periods.
      <li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
    I don't fully understand the question but one skill I would like to develop is my ability to work productively & efficiently in my own time. I have never been one for time-management & self-management, but this is something I can tell I will not be able to get through this course without.
      <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        <ol>1. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representitives</ol>  
        <ol>2. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</ol>
      </li>
    I will manage my workload during this programme by ensuring I accurately respond to deadlines, and timeboxes for tasks. Completing my technical and cultural development tasks in an efficient manner is important to me, as this will give me time through each week to reflect on my work & ask for relevent help if necessary. If I find myself to be struggling with content or time-management I will be conscious to reach out and find appropriate help.
      <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
    The provided platforms of Discord & Slack have already proved extremely effective in finding out further information, or reaching out about something I get stuck on. My homegroup text chat is my first port of call, failing that I will notify facilitators via DM, or broadly in the foundations groupchat.      
      <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
    The facilitation team has already proved supportive and tentitive to my needs. Respect & communication is expected, but of course this can only be mutual! :)
      <li>Any scheduling information such as block out times when you are committed to other things.</li>
    Time is one thing that I have given myself plenty of between now and the end of the course. All day every day - I am available to be working on content.
