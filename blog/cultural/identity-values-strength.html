    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <p>
      <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</li>
    Through highschool I was subject to, and witnessed quite a lot of bullying, some physical and some emotional. On one occasion I witnessed a peer who suffered from a disability that was being physically bullied, something that made me sick to the core. It didn't feel like a choice at the time however I got in a pretty big physical altercation with the instigators & ended up in a significant amount of trouble. I am a highly empathetic person, and what I was witnessing was a sign of total disrespect which goes entirely against my ethics and beliefs. I don't regret my decision or the outcome, however in hindsight I would have approached the whole situation in more of a cool-headed manner.
      <li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li>
    I was majorly influenced by the people in my family growing up. I cherish the fact that everybody in my family are so close, and growing up this had enormous impact on my understanding of relationships. My brothers are much older than me, making my parents quite old too. Having an enormous support network has its benefits on its own, especially with the matured EQ of my immediate family. I have been subject to love, loss & fun from a young age in immense quantity, and I believe this to be a major contributor of my strong sense of morals and ethics. Social interaction is a quintessential part of who I am and my buzzing family is entirely to thank for this.
      <li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li>
    I am a passionately curious individual, and will not hesitate to ask questions to further develop my understanding of complex ideas & technologies. My greatest trait is my interpersonal skills, and this will help me confidently ask questions if stuck, and communicate ideas and reasonings in a positive way to my teammates. I am open-minded and accept criticism well, as listening and taking things on-board are a fundamental to inter-personal skills.  
      <li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
    Historically I have been a fairly lazy and unstructured worker & learner in environments that do not pique my interest. This could impact my learning journey significantly, as without structure and dedication I will not be able to complete the programme. 
      <li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li>
    When working at a bar in Christchurch I was given a role with extra managerial responsibilities, while still working inside a fast-paced high stress bar team environment. At the time, I did not have a good understanding of what it meant to be in a leadership role, which meant I lead the team in a fairly ineffective manner. We were all close friends, and I didn't provide the necessary level of respect to the team for it to be reciprocated. I struggled to communicate my ideas & strategies to the team, and they struggled to listen due to this hierarchical structure. Looking back I would ensure to be a lot more collaborative and envolved with the team, and enjoy working with them on issues that they were facing in order to better develop the relationship.
