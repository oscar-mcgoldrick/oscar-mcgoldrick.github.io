    <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that works in conjunction with HTML and CSS to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. One way to think about the relationship between these three technologies is to compare them to a construction site. HTML provides the structure, or the foundation of the site. CSS adds style and design elements, like paint and decorations. JavaScript, on the other hand, is like the tools and machinery used to build and manipulate the site. It can add animations, create pop-ups, and respond to user interactions in real-time.</p>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which a program executes its instructions. Loops are a way to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. One example of a process that involves control flow and loops is making a sandwich. The control flow might look something like this: First, gather ingredients. Next, spread condiments on the bread. Then, add the meat, cheese, and vegetables. Finally, cut the sandwich in half and serve. To repeat this process for multiple sandwiches, we could use a loop. For example, we could repeat the block of code that adds the meat, cheese, and vegetables until we have used up all of our ingredients.</p>
        <p>The Document Object Model, or DOM, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. An example of interacting with the DOM might be using JavaScript to change the color of a button when it is clicked. We could access the button element using the document.querySelector() method, and then use the .style property to change the button's background color.</p>
        <p>Arrays and objects are two ways to store and access data in JavaScript. Arrays are collections of ordered, indexed values. We access data from arrays using bracket notation, like array[0]. Objects, on the other hand, are collections of key-value pairs. We access data from objects using dot notation, like object.property.</p>
        <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called and executed multiple times throughout a program. They are helpful because they allow us to write code once and use it many times. They can also take in arguments and return values, which allows us to make our code more modular and flexible. For example, we could write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle based on its length and width, and then call that function whenever we need to calculate the area of a rectangle.</p>
