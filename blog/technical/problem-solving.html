    <h1>Taking a look at how I problem solve</h1>
    <p>
        <li>A time I was blocked on a simple problem:</li>
        The problem was that I was trying to install a new software on my computer, but it kept giving me an error message and would not complete the installation.
        <div></div>
        I tried the following problem-solving techniques:
        <div></div>
        - I read the error message carefully to see if it gave any clues as to what the issue was.
        <div></div>
        - I searched online forums to see if others had experienced the same problem and found any solutions.
        <div></div>
        - I restarted my computer and tried the installation process again.
        <div></div>
        - I tried a different version of the software to see if that would work.
        <div></div>
        Throughout the process, I felt frustrated and a bit discouraged that I couldn't figure out the problem. However, I tried to stay focused and persistent in finding a solution.
        <div></div>
        I learned that sometimes even simple problems can be challenging to solve, and it's important to remain patient and persistent in the face of difficulties.
        <li>A time I elegantly solved a problem:</li>
        The problem was that I was trying to create a complex Excel formula to track various computers for a university, but I was having trouble getting the formula to work correctly.
        <div></div>
        I used the following problem-solving techniques:
        <div></div>
        - I broke down the formula into smaller parts to try to isolate where the issue was.
        <div></div>
        - I used the Excel help feature to look up specific functions and syntax.
        <div></div>
        - I tested the formula with different inputs to see where it was failing.
        <div></div>
        - I asked a colleague for help, who was able to provide a fresh perspective on the problem and suggest a solution.
        <div></div>
        Throughout the process, I felt challenged but also engaged and motivated to solve the problem.
        <div></div>
        I learned that sometimes even complex problems can be solved with perseverance, creativity, and the willingness to ask for help when needed.
        <li>Reflecting on my confidence in my usage of problem solving techniques:</li>
        Pseudocode: I feel very confident in my ability to pseudocode, as it is a technique that I use frequently in my work and find to be helpful in breaking down complex problems.
        <div></div>
        Trying something: I am confident in my ability to try different solutions and experiment with different approaches to a problem. Failure in reaching a solution isn't massively scary to me, just motivating!
        <div></div>
        Rubber ducky method: I have not used this method extensively, but I am willing to try it and see if it helps me in problem-solving.
        <div></div>
        Reading error messages: I feel moderately confident in my ability to read error messages and understand what they are communicating. I recognise the importance of this one, and will work to improve my ability here.
        <div></div>
        Console.logging: I am confident in my ability to use console.log() to debug code and understand what is happening in my code.
        <div></div>
        Googling: I am confident in my ability to search for solutions online and find relevant resources to help me solve a problem.
        <div></div>
        Asking peers for help: I feel comfortable asking my peers for help when I need it, and I value the perspectives and insights they can provide. This is one tool that I feel is extremely underappraciated and under-used.
        <div></div>
        Asking coaches for help: I am comfortable asking coaches for help when I need it, and I appreciate the guidance and support they can offer.
        <div></div>
        Improving your process with reflection: I feel moderately confident in my ability to reflect on my problem-solving process and identify areas for improvement. This is something that I am expecting to learn as I work with other people, so that I can get more ideas about my own work in a retrospective fashion.
        <li>My reluctance to ask for help:</li>
        There have been times when I have been reluctant to ask for help, usually because I worry that it will make me appear incompetent or inexperienced. However, I have learned that asking for help is an essential part of learning and growing, and that it is better to ask for help and learn something new than to struggle on my own and potentially waste time and resources. To overcome my reluctance, I try to remind myself of the benefits of asking for help and focus on building positive relationships with my colleagues and mentors who can support me in my learning and growth.
