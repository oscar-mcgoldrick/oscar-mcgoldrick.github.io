    <h1>CSS Concepts</h1>
    <p>CSS classes and IDs are used to style and modify the appearance of HTML elements on a webpage. Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using classes and IDs in CSS: </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use classes to group elements that have similar styles: Classes are used to apply the same styles to multiple elements. It's best to use classes to group elements that have similar styles. For example, if you have a group of buttons that all have the same background color and font size, you could create a class called "button" and apply it to each button.</li>
        <li>Use IDs for unique elements: IDs are used to apply unique styles to a single element. It's important to remember that IDs should only be used once per page. For example, if you have a navigation menu at the top of your page, you could give it an ID of "nav" and style it with CSS.</li>
        <li>Don't use IDs for styling purposes: Although you can use IDs to apply styles to an element, it's not a recommended practice. IDs should be used for identifying elements, not for styling them. It's better to use classes for styling purposes, and reserve IDs for unique elements that need to be identified.</li>
        <li>Keep class and ID names descriptive: When naming classes and IDs, it's important to choose descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the element. This makes it easier to understand the code and modify it later on. For example, instead of naming a class "red-text", it's better to name it "important-text" if it's used to highlight important information.</li>
        <li>Don't overuse classes and IDs: It's important to use classes and IDs sparingly and only when necessary. Overusing them can make the code harder to read and maintain. It's better to use a combination of HTML elements and classes to style the page.</li>
      </ol>
